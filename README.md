# Hub - app on React/Redux.
It strange applicaation on React, nothing more.

## Setup
For project setup I recomend to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) insted of npm. But it's just a recomendation and you can use npm with this project all the same.
After cloning repository use command
```
yarn
```
or
```
npm i
```
for instaling packages.
